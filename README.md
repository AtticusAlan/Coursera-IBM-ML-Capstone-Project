Load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. </br>
Using the following algorithms to build the models: </br>

* k-Nearest Neighbour </br>

* Decision Tree </br>

* Support Vector Machine </br>

* Logistic Regression </br>

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable: </br>

* Jaccard index </br>

* F1-score </br>

* LogLoass </br>
